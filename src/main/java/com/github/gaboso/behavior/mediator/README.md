# Mediator Design Pattern

* The **Mediator Design Pattern** is one of the _Gang of Four design patterns_ which is used to control and
reduce complexity of communication among groups of objects.

* The **Mediator Pattern** is a behavioral pattern which defines an object to encapsulate the interaction between objects.

* The **Mediator Pattern** helps us to reduce chaotic dependencies between objects.

* The **Mediator Pattern** helps us to restrict any direct communication between the objects and allow us
to collaborate objects only via a **mediator** object.

* By using **Mediator** object we can control communication between objects.

* The **Mediator** object also hides the complexity of communication between objects.

* The **Mediator Pattern** defines a mediator class to handle all the communications between different classes.
That also supports easy maintenance of the communication related code by using loose coupling.

* The **Chatting** Application is a good example of Mediator pattern where a group of chat users communicates
 with each other via the char server.

* The **Whatsapp** is another good example of the Mediator pattern.
Whatsapp server handles all the communication between different whatsapp users.

* **Air Traffic Control System** is also another great example in which all flights doing takeoff or landing communicates
 with the Air Traffic Control to manage their safe and smooth movement.
